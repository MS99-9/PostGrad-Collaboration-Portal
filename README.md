# PostGrad Collaboration Portal
 The theme of the project is extending Universities Administration Web Portal. It will focus on supporting the postgraduate students and professors through enabling them to collaborate remotely (online) on writing and reviewing their thesis or conference and journal submissions.Design a web portal that will enable the GUC postgraduate students to collaborate with internal professors, as well as professors from external global universities. We will refer to it as “PostGrad Collaboration Portal”.

Deliverables :


1. Requirements and System Design :


a) A graphical representation of the Storyboard
b) The User Story Map
c) A requirements sheets of the user requirements, and their corresponding system requirements, covering all stakeholders of the system:
• PostGraduate Students • Supervisory Professors
d) A report of the non-functional requirements of the system
e) A graphical representation of the subsystems and the modules making up the system.
f) The Sequence Diagrams describing, for each subsystem, the two most-dependent-on requirements.
g) The Class Diagram describing all the entities and their interactions in the system.

2. UX Design and Product Plan :

a) a mid- to-high fidelity clickable mockup of the main user journeys within this MVP.
b) a product roadmap (plan) that provides predictability to the entire product development process. The purpose of this roadmap is to allow the stakeholders of the PostGrad Collaboration Portal to plan, allocate resources, and coordinate future activities. In this plan, I have to clearly articulate its business goals and consequential strategies of delivering the PostGrad Collaboration Portal. The plan should include high-level information that can be easily understood by internal and external audiences.

3. Testing Plan & Client Acceptance Presentation :

a) the APIs schema relevant only to the main features of the portal.
b) the regression test cases of the main features related to the remote collaboration on writing and reviewing the thesis or conference and journal submissions.
c) online presentation with a duration of five minutes.
